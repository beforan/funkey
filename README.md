# FunKey

This is a quick "game" I made for when my kids want to mash the keyboard.

Open in a browser, F11 for full screen and let them see the keys they press come up, and the colors change.

Right-click is disabled, so pretty much they have to hit `F1` (Help) `F11` (exit full screen) or `F12` (Developer Tools) to get out of there.
